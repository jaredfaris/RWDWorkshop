Bootstrap also has the concept of a Jumbotron: http://getbootstrap.com/components/#jumbotron
This would be the widget to use if you needed a big header section with interactive elements and more complex HTML

You can try a jumbotron with this:

            <div class="jumbotron clearfix">
                <img src="Content/Images/Store_clip_art.svg" alt="Acme Co" class="pull-right img-responsive">
                <h1>Acme Co</h1>
                <p>We've got inventory!</p>
            </div>

Additional classes added:

To the div/jumbotron, additional classes
	clearfix -- clears the image

To the image inside the jumbotron, add class				
	pull-right -- floats the image right. Guess what to use for making the image float left instead?

	img-responsive -- makes the image resize responsively. Image stays a fixed size otherwise.
