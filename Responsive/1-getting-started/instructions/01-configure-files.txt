1. Create a folder on your desktop called "Inventory". This is our working directory for the project.

2. Unzip the bootstrap-3.1.1-dist.zip file in the start folder. You need 3 folders: css, fonts, js. Copy these three folders into the Inventory folder.

3. Copy the jquery-1.11.0.min.js file to the Scripts folder inside of the inventory folder.
	This is an older version of jQuery but that's ok for this workshop. Newer versions would likely work.

4. Create a folder inside of the inventory folder called "Content". Create a folder called "Images" inside of it.
	Go to the images/ folder copy the image from here to the Content/Images folder.
	Preserve the file and folder structure. (You do not have to copy the text credits file.)

5. Create a "Styles" folder in Content. Create a blank css document inside of the Styles folder called custom.css

6. Copy index.html to the inventory folder. (This is a basic starting HTML5 document.)

7. The final folder and file structure inside of the inventory folder should be as follows:

Inventory
	Content
	    Styles
		    bootstrap.css
		    bootstrap.min.css
		    bootstrap-theme.min.css
		    bootstrap-theme.css
		    custom.css
	
        Fonts
            glyphiconshalflines-regular.eot, .svg, .ttf, .woff

        Images
            2 folders of images (large, thumbs) plus 15 individual images in this folder

	Scripts
		bootstrap.js
		bootstrap.min.js
		jquery-1.10.2.min.js

	index.html

8. Add the viewport meta tag to the head of the document:
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    What do you think this does?


9. Link the bootstrap.min.css and custom.css files in the head of the document.
    <link href="Content/Styles/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
    <link href="Content/Styles/custom.css" rel="stylesheet">

10. At the bottom of the document, just before the </body> tag, link to the jquery and bootstrap.min.js documents:

	<!-- javascript -->
	<script src="Scripts/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"></script>
    <script src="Scripts/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
