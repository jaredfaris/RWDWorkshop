From the starting apples page, add tabs to the page as follows:

1. Add class of "nav nav-tabs" to the UL with ID of tabNav

2. Add data-toggle="tab" to each A in the UL

3. Link each href in the A in the UL to each ID (overview, botanical, wild, genome)

4. Surround the overview, botanical, wild, genome div's with IDs with a single div with class of "tab-content"

5. For the overview div, add classes of tab-pane and active. For wild, genome, and botanical divs, add a class of tab-pane

6. View in browser -- links work, but the active tab is not highlighted until some clicking around happens.

7. To make the active tab truly active, must be initialized with jQuery. After the bootstrap.min.js call at the bottom of the page, add the following:

    <script>
        $(function () {
         $('#tabNav a:first').tab('show');
         });
    </script>


'#tabNav a:first' is a selector that selects the first tab. If you wish to select a different tab, substitute an appropriate selector here. (Could also say '#tabNav #overview')
