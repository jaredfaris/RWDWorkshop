Grids explained in detail here:
http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid

Insert 4 rows into the body of the HTML page. First row is for nav, second for jumbotron (header area), third for the 4 forms/tables, 4th for the footer.

In the 3rd row, set this up to have two columns. The first column should take up 8 of the 12 grid spots. The second should take up the remaining 4. They should both become full width below medium size.

NOTE: we've decided that the update list gets hidden on mobile devices because it's of secondary importance. Make it hide if we're on an extra small display.

4th row: change to footer tag, insert a privacy statement. Center the text.

NOTE: nav tag will be inserted ***later*** for the navigation row.
