Grids explained in detail here:
http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid

Insert 4 rows into the body of the HTML page. First row is for nav, second for jumbotron (header area), third for the 4 forms/tables, 4th for the footer.

In the 3rd row, set this up to show 4 images across at sm/md/lg sizes, plus 2 rows of images with 2 images per row at xs size.

NOTE: we've decided that the update list gets hidden on mobile devices because it's of secondary importance

4th row: change to footer tag, insert a privacy statement. We've also centered the text there

NOTE: nav tag will be inserted ***later*** for the navigation row.
