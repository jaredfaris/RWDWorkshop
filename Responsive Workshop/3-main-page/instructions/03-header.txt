Header: http://getbootstrap.com/components/#page-header

We want to add a header that says "Acme Co" and a subheader that says something about inventory.

Add code below to line 19 in index.html

            <div class="page-header">
                <h1>Acme Co <small>We inventory your stuff!</small></h1>
            </div>
