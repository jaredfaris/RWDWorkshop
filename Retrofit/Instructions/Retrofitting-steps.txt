This is much less of a "follow the instructions" and more of a free-form exercise. This guide should help give you
    direction but treat this as more of a sandbox for learning.

Note: The numbering in this document matches the folder structure differently than other exercises. You can follow along
    as we attempt to clean up a few things.

00) The first thing to do is figure out if/when the site breaks on smaller devices. For instance, the site seems to start
    having a horizontal scroll bar around 915px wide. This may be our first break. Something seems to be causing this.


01) Look at the <div class="page"> element. It has a fixed width. That's not going to work. We can maybe set a media
    query to only set a fixed width on large screens.

        .page {
            margin: 0px auto 0px auto;
        }

        @media (min-width: 915px){
            .page {
                width: 863px;
            }
        }

02) The header is sort of starting to work now on smaller displays. The logo can overlap when it gets small enough though.
    We don't like that much. That seems to happen around 625px. Let's break that up. It appears there is a style on
    "header #title h1 a" that causes the logo to "position: absolute" that we can remove.

    The header image would look better centered at this point too. Let's do that and give it a bit of margin.

        @media (max-width: 625px) {
            header #title h1 a {
                position: inherit;
                margin: 10px auto;
            }
        }

    The header has a fixed height. That's not great because it causes the background image to do weird things. Let's remove that.

        @media (max-width: 625px) {
            header {
                height: auto;
            }
        }

    This has the navigation do something odd. Oh, that's positioned absolutely too. Lovely. Let's make that follow the
    block positioning flow and center it too. The UL and LIs float which wreaks havoc here too. We'll convert them to
    "display: block"

        @media (max-width: 625px) {
            nav {
                position: relative;
                right: 0;
                bottom: 0;
            }

            nav ul#menu {
                overflow: hidden;
                display: inline-block;
                margin: 0px;
                float: none;
            }

            nav ul#menu li {
                float: none;
                display: inline-block;
            }
        }
