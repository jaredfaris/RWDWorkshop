We can now start thinking about how we want items to render on various screen sizes.

1) At above a 600px wide window, we'd like the grid items to show up 2 per row. We can do this by creating a media query
  that specifies this. Add this to your stylesheet.css file. Placing these styles near their corresponding non-media query
  elements will help make them easier to find.

    @media screen and (min-width: 600px) {
      .grid-item {
        width: 48%;
        float: left;
        margin-right: 4%;
      }

      .grid-item:nth-child(2n+2) {
        margin-right: 0;
      }
    }

2) On a wider device, we can go to 4 items on a row. This media query will allow for that to happen. Place it in your
  stylesheet.css file.

    @media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
      .grid-item, .grid-item:nth-child(2n+2) {
        width: 23.5%;
        margin-right: 2%;
      }

      .grid-item:last-child {
        margin-right: 0;
      }
    }

3) We may also want the buttons in the footer to be side by side on a larger screen. Let's do the same thing here.

    @media screen and (min-width: 600px) {
      footer button {
        width: 49%;
        float: left;
        margin-bottom: 0;
      }

      footer button:first-child {
        margin-right: 2%;
      }
    }
