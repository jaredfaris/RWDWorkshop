We want our logo to float to the left of the header and the navigation to float to the right.

1) Add styles for the logo element and main-navigation element (identified by classes) to tell them how to float. Put
  these styles in stylesheet.css.

  .logo {
    float: left;
  }

  .main-navigation {
    float: right;
  }


2) Notice that they no longer display. The parent container doesn't understand how tall the contents are now because of
  how they are floated. There is a common fix for this known as "clearfix" that we can apply. Add this to stylesheet.css

  .clearfix::after {
    clear: both;
    content: "";
    display: table;
  }

  Also, add clearfix to the main site header like this:

      <header class="main-site-header">
        <div class="container clearfix">  <--- HERE

  Notice how the container is now tall enough to house all of it's children
