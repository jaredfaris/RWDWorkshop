# RWD Workshop

This workshop is intended to teach students the basics of RWD including:
* What is RWD?
* Media queries
* Responsive grids
* Flexbox
* Variable fonts

There are other things that likely should be presented alongside of the workshop code. I may get around to adding those here later.

Cheers,
Jared



Note: Big thanks to [Jen Kramer](http://www.jenkramer.org/) for planting the original seed for this workshop. It's evolved quite a lot since but the instructional format and original content owes a lot to her.
