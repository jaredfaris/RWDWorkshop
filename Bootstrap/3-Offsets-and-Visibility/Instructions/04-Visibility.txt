Sometimes you want to be able to hide content at certain sizes. For instance, you might want to change from a wide
    but short "landscape" graphic on a wide screen, and change to a narrow but taller "portrait" on a narrow screen.

Note: It's often considered bad form to not make content available to people, just because they are on a smaller device.
    However, there may be times where you have two controls rendering similar content that may be optimized differently.

To make things visible or inivisible at certain sizes, use the ".hidden-XX" or ".visible-XX" classes.

A DIV marked with "visible" *only* displays at the size specified. A DIV marked with "hidden" displays at all sizes
    *other* than the one specified. You can have multiple classes on a DIV if you want it to hide at multiple sizes.

1) Create a new row with a 12 column DIV that shows up only on medium and large screens.

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-12 hidden-sm hidden-xs">I'm a banner</div>
        </div>



2) Inside this row, add another 12 column DIV to represent content that you might put under this banner. Don't set visibility on this.

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-12 hidden-sm hidden-xs">I'm a banner</div>
  NEW -->   <div class="col-md-12">I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. </div>
        </div>



3) Notice how the banner disappears if you narrow your window or use a tablet or phone. Let's create a new vertical
    banner that *only* shows up on the narrower devices.

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-12 hidden-sm hidden-xs">I'm a banner</div>
            <div class="col-md-12">I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. I'm content. </div>
  NEW -->   <div class="col-xs-3 visible-xs-block visible-sm-block">Vertical Banner</div>
        </div>


4) Notice how the Vertical Banner shows up on the small screens, but the content is still full width? We need to tell
    the content to change to fewer columns on the smaller device. Change the content row to:

        <div class="col-xs-9 col-md-12">

5) Now verify that the horizontal banner hides on small displays and that the vertical one shows up adjacent to the content.
