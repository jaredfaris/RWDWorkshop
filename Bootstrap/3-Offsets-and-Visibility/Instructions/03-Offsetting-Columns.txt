Sometimes you want to have space between columns. You can offset columns by using the "col-XX-##" class. For instance,
    you may want to do something like this.


[                 col-md-12                 ]
  <blank space>   [ col-md-8 col-md-offset-4]


Offsets are frequently used when you need to add spaces between elements, or to align an element down the page with
something higher up.

1) Create a new row in your grid and put a 3 column DIV in it. Offset this by 3 columns so it lines up under the 2nd DIV
    above it.

                <div class="col-sm-3 col-sm-offset-3">col-sm-3 col-sm-offset-3</div>

2) Create a second 3 column DIV by this one. Don't offset it so that it's adjacent. Your final page should look like this:

        [ div ][ div ][ div ][ div ]
               [ div ][ div ]

3) Look at what happens to these divs as you resize them. Notice how they stay centered, even when the first row
    changes at the col-sm-6 breakpoint.
