This example already has Bootstrap installed. We'll look at how to install it during the Responsive lab.

We're going to create a grid that has columns of a few different sizes, similar to what you see on the Bootstrap site.
    View the site (here: http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid) for more details.

NOTE: The custom.css file has some styles in it that will make our grid stand out visually so you can see what is
    happening. This won't normally be the case and you will be able to style your content as you choose.

1) Open the Start folder and find the DIV with the class "container". That starts our Bootstrap grid.

2) Add a row with two col-lg-6 columns. These will each take up half of the grid, and quickly break to take up a full
    row on anything other than a large monitor.

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-6">.col-lg-6</div>
                <div class="col-lg-6">.col-lg-6</div>
            </div>

3) Resize your browser, or use the Responsive/Device Mode viewer to see these columns break.

4) Add a row with some col-md-* columns. These will sit side by side on desktops and some tablets.

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6">.col-md-6</div>
            <div class="col-md-4">.col-md-4</div>
            <div class="col-md-2">.col-md-2</div>
        </div>

5) Again, resize your browser to view these breaking.

6) Add a row with some small and extra small columns. The small columns will stay adjacent on tablets but break on
    most phones. The XS columns will always stay adjacent.

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-1">.col-sm-1</div>
                <div class="col-sm-1">.col-sm-1</div>
                <div class="col-sm-1">.col-sm-1</div>
                <div class="col-xs-1">.col-xs-1</div>
                <div class="col-xs-4">.col-xs-4</div>
                <div class="col-sm-4">.col-sm-4</div>
            </div>

7) Again, resize your browser and see how this works.
