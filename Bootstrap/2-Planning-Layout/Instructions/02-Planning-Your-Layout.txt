Generally when laying out a grid, you'll have a design in mind. For instance, you might want the following:

    On mobile devices: 1 column
    On tablets: 2 columns
    On desktops: 4 columns

You can do this by applying multiple classes to each column.

1) Open the Index.html file in Start. Delete the existing rows until you have an empty DIV with the class "container".

2) Create four columns that each have the class "col-sm-6". This will cause them to show up individually on extra-small
    (phone) devices but sit in pairs on tablets:

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-6">col-sm-6</div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">col-sm-6</div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">col-sm-6</div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">col-sm-6</div>
        </div>

3) View this in your browser or use the Device Viewer to see this like it would render on an iPhone 6 or iPad 4.

4) Next, we want to tell these columns to display 4 across on a desktop. Do this by adding the class "col-md-3" to each
    column:

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-6 col-lg-3">col-sm-6</div>
            <div class="col-sm-6 col-lg-3">col-sm-6</div>
            <div class="col-sm-6 col-lg-3">col-sm-6</div>
            <div class="col-sm-6 col-lg-3">col-sm-6</div>
        </div>


5) Use your browser to verify that this shows up as a single column at small sizes, two columns at medium sizes, and 4
    columns on the desktop. *Note* Depending on your laptops resolution, you may need to use "col-md-3" instead of
    "col-lg-3" to get these to display correctly. Large will work for any device over 1170px wide.
